      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm BinaryChaos! Online, at least. You can call me 'Binary' for short. I chose BinaryChaos as my username back when I was about 14 years old for my love of computers and programming. Computers have evolved tremendously over the course of their existence. A their core however, computers are still machines only capable of reading small electrical currents in a binary format, in 1s and 0s. As you can imagine, it all gets pretty chaotic. Hence, BinaryChaos.</p>
      <p>My first experience with computer programming was in high school, where I learned some Visual Basic and some HTML. You can picture a grade 10 boy at the back of the class, not listening to a word from the teacher, hacking away at a computer and recreating basic games like Pong and Pacman. I also made some fan websites (they were never hosted, nor did I keep them) for some of my favourite video games. Yep. I was THAT nerd. I'm pretty sure I only got a good grade in that course from helping my classmates finish their own projects.</p>
      <p>Despite what you may think at this point, I am not a computer programmer. I am not a software developer, nor an engineer. Nope. I'm a middle school French & Science Teacher. I didn't go down that route as my grades in Math weren't strong enough at the time. In fact, my appreciation and love for programming was taking up so much of my time that my grades in other subjects started to suffer. As any responsible parent would, my parents stepped in and steered me away from programming. Little did they know at the time, or I, that software development would become such a desirable field. In hindsight, I'm sure they would have done things differently. Now, I code on my free time, make scripts that take more time creating than it actually saves, and teach my students the basics of Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript. There are times I reconsider my choice of career path. When this happens, I follow some online courses and create personal projects for myself, like this one.</p>
