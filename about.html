      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I've always been interested in technology. In computers and
      coding, to be more specific. My first experience with computer
      programming was in high school, where I learned some Visual Basic
      and some HTML. You can picture a grade 10 boy at the back of the
      class, not listening to a word from the teacher, hacking away at a
      computer and recreating basic games like Pong and Pacman. I also
      made some fan websites (they were never hosted, nor did I keep
      them) for some of my favourite video games. Yep. I was THAT nerd.
      I'm pretty sure I only got a good grade in that course from
      helping my classmates finish their own projects. And at that time,
      knowing how to code or program wasn't "cool".</p>
     
      <p>And yet, I am not a computer programmer. I am not a software
      developer, nor an engineer. Nope. I am a middle school French &
      Science Teacher. I didn't go down that route as my grades in Math
      weren't strong enough at the time. In fact, my appreciation and
      love for programming took up so much of my time that my grades in
      other subjects started to suffer. As any responsible parent would,
      my parents stepped in and steered me away from programming. Little
      did they know at the time, or I, that software development would
      become such a desirable field. In hindsight, I'm sure they would
      have done things differently. Now, I code on my free time, make
      scripts that take more time to create than it actually saves, and
      teach my students the basics of Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
      I occasionally reconsider my career path. When I get an itch to
      code, I follow some online courses and create personal projects
      for myself, like this one.</p>

      <p>ControlShiftEd is a passion project, an amalgamation
      of side projects to make educators, and the general population,
      more knowledgeable about computers, software development and
      technological literacy. The goal is to share my knowledge, my
      discoveries, and my tools with you. I hope this ripples into a
      self-interest for you to learn about concepts yourself. I believe in the power of Free and Open
      Source Software (FOSS) to get it done. What better
      way to learn about something than when it's freely available to
      use and explore? Grab a pen and paper, a notebook, open up your favourite text
      editor, and let's learn together! 

      <p>There are plenty of things I want to do and
      show off down the pipeline. I hope I have the time and energy to
      accomplish them all. In the meantime, feel free to peruse through
      my notes and other projects I've developed!</p>
